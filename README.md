### What I learned

In this project I learned to used `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` javaScript functions.

The `Math.floor()` function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number. 

The `Math.random()` function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less than 1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number generation algorithm

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
const getRandomInt = (min, max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min) + min)
let randonInt = getRandomInt(1, 224)
```
